# `@hookorama/supervisor`

The Hookorama supervisor: one process per machine, installed as a
user-mode local service. Owns the live in-memory state and (in a
later PR) the append-only SQLite history. The only writer in the
system.

PR 2 ships the supervisor _skeleton_: the public `Supervisor`
class, identity resolution, the live state store with virtual
subagent nesting, cross-platform process discovery, and the
PID-file slot lifecycle with stale-PID reclaim. The wire
protocol (NDJSON socket + HTTP) and the Drizzle persistence
layer ship in later PRs; they are pinned by ADRs 0003 and 0004
(see `ROADMAP.md` Phase 2).
